Open arudino IDE as root

robert@robert-carbon ~/rob/arduino-1.8.10 $ sudo ./arduino

1. install adafruit sensor & bme280 libraries
2. make sure to sync board to get arduino zero
3. board: arduino zero (programming port) the one closer to the cylindrical power
4. port: /dev/ttyACM0
5. compile & upload

You can install the adafruit libraries now right from the arduino IDE

Keep in mind that there is an arduino folder within /home/robert and a versioned one within ~/rob/arduino-1.8.10
